First Machine Learning Projects is Email Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes Algorithms And Second Project is Loan approval by Bank using Logistics Regression.
Email Spam Classifier is a guided project but loan approval ML project is my own.
Both the projects were done to get the basic knowledge of how actually a ML model works having the application of different algorithms.
